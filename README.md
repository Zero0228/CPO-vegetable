# CPO-vegetable
# Lab 1

– title:Laboratory works
– group name:Vegetable
- group members:Zhuo Lin, Liu Fen
– laboratory work number：6
– variant description：Dictionary based on binary-tree
– synopsis：Use binary search tree to realize the operation of key-value pairs
– contribution summary for each group member (should be checkable by git log and git blame)
  Zhuo Lin:Implement and test the immutable versions.
  Liu Fen:Implement and test the mutable versions.
– explanation of taken design decisions and analysis
  Immutable versions: The size of the key value is used to select the node insertion, find the location of the binary search tree, delete the node according to the characteristics   of the binary search tree, and transform the binary search tree into a list or process the node value according to the order of the pre-order traversal.
– work demonstration (how to use developed software, how to test it), should be repeatable by the teacher by given command-line examples
  Immutable version：Use the immutable version by import the file and use the function directly.
– conclusion: The mutable version is more flexible and easier to use than the immutable version.
